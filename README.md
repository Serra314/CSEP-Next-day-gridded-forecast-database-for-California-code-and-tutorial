# Next-day gridded forecast database for California (code and tutorial)

Repository containing the code and tutorial to evaluate against observed data, and compare against each other, models from the next-day CSEP forecast database for California. The files contained here are supplementary material for the article *A Database of Ten Years of Prospective Next-Day Earthquake Forecasts in California from the Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability* on Nature Scientific Data.

The tutorial provides guidance on how to install pyCSEP; how to download the models in the Next-day CSEP forecasts database for California; how to load and visualise forecasts; how to create cumulative forecasts for custom time periods; how to perform CSEP consistency and comparison tests. The code contains all the function illustrated in the tutorial. Both heavily relies on the use of the [pyCSEP toolkit](https://github.com/SCECcode/pycsep).
